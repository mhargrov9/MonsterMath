Technical Prompt for Replit AI Review
Do not write any code. Review these instructions and let me know if it fits our overall strategy and if it violates any of the unbreakable rules (without writing code). A quick summary of our unbreakable rules:

Architecture Compliance: Every change must align with server-authoritative, database-driven design.

Authentic Data Only: No mock, placeholder, or hardcoded data allowed.

. Also, please let me know if you think this will solve the following problems:

Problem 1: The handleBattleStart function in BattleArena.tsx incorrectly overwrites the initial battle log received from the server.

Problem 2: The client violates the "dumb client" principle by generating its own log messages instead of purely displaying the server's authoritative log.

Architectural Mandate Reminder
Before proceeding, review this core project directive: The server is the only brain; the client is only hands and eyes.

All game logic, rule validation, and calculations must occur on the server, primarily within server/battleEngine.ts. All dynamic values (costs, multipliers, chances, etc.) must be read from the database. The client must remain "dumb" and only render the state and log provided by the server. There are no exceptions.

1. Goal:
Fix the handleBattleStart function in client/src/components/BattleArena.tsx to correctly display the initial battle log provided by the server without overwriting it.

2. File Modifications:

client/src/components/BattleArena.tsx

3. Implementation Details:

Navigate to the handleBattleStart function.

Locate the line that sets the battle log after a successful API call.

The current code is: setBattleLog(['Battle is about to begin! Select your starting monster.']);

Modify this line to use the authoritative log from the server's battleState and append the new message to it. The corrected logic should be: setBattleLog(battleState.battleLog.concat('Battle is about to begin! Select your starting monster.'));

4. Architecture Compliance Check:

Does this change ensure the client displays the full, initial log from the server?

Does this fix the architectural violation where the client was overwriting server state?
