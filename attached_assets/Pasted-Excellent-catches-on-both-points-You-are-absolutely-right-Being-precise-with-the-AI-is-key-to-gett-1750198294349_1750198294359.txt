Your 'Replit' Request (Revised and Finalized)
"I need you to implement the full upgrade paths for the five 'Starter Set' monsters. These five monsters should be the initial creatures available for players to purchase with Gold in the Monster Lab.

Please update the game's database to support a multi-level upgrade path for each one. When a player upgrades a monster, the system must update its stats, abilities, and card image to match the data for its new level.

Here is the complete data for each monster's upgrade path:

1. Geode Tortoise

Level 1 (Base):
