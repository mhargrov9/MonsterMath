Code Review Analysis
I have analyzed the three files you provided (config/gameData.ts, server/gameData.ts, and server/routes.ts) to ensure the removal of hardcoded game data.

server/routes.ts (Approved ✅)

The agent has correctly modified the API routes to fetch game data from the database instead of using hardcoded constants.
For example, the /api/generate/monster-image endpoint now correctly queries the database for the monster's name (const monsters = await storage.getAllMonsters();).
Similarly, /api/battle/generate-opponent now calls storage.generateAiOpponent(...), which correctly abstracts the logic for creating AI teams away from the routes file.
All relevant endpoints (/api/monsters, /api/ai-teams) now properly use the storage layer. This aligns perfectly with our goal of a scalable, database-driven architecture.
server/gameData.ts & config/gameData.ts (Cleanup Required ⚠️)

The agent correctly removed the hardcoded monster and AI data. The remaining constants in these files (MAX_BATTLE_SLOTS, BATTLE_TOKEN_REFRESH_HOURS, etc.) are true application constants and are appropriately placed.
However, we now have two very similar files for constants. The routes.ts file is currently importing from server/gameData.ts (import { SERVER_CONSTANTS } from "./gameData";). This makes the config/gameData.ts file redundant and a potential source of confusion.
The config/gameData.ts file contains one extra constant, DEFAULT_BATTLE_TOKENS: 5, which we should merge into the primary server/gameData.ts file to create a single source of truth.
Next Step: Consolidate Constants
To finalize this refactor and maintain a clean codebase, we will consolidate all constants into the server/gameData.ts file and delete config/gameData.ts.

Please perform the following file modifications:

Update server/gameData.ts

Find the file: server/gameData.ts
Replace its entire content with the following code to merge the constants from both files and standardize the export name to SERVER_CONSTANTS.
<!-- end list -->

TypeScript

// server/gameData.ts

// Server-side game constants only.
// All dynamic data (monsters, abilities, AI opponents) comes from the database.

export const SERVER_CONSTANTS = {
  MAX_BATTLE_SLOTS: 5,
  BASE_BATTLE_SLOTS: 2,
  MAX_MONSTER_LEVEL: 10,
  BATTLE_TOKEN_REFRESH_HOURS: 4,
  DEFAULT_BATTLE_TOKENS: 5, // Merged from config/gameData.ts
} as const;
Delete config/gameData.ts

Please delete the redundant config/gameData.ts file from the project.
Once you have completed these two steps, the refactor will be complete, and our codebase will be in a stable, scalable state, ready for the next phase of feature development. Let me know when this is done.
